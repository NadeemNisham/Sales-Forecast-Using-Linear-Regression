# Sales-Forecast-Using-Linear-Regression
As part of a personal project to learn more about some machine learning algorithms and forecasting, I chose to look into and examine sales forecasting techniques. The notebook in this repository can be used to forecast a company's product sales. To accomplish this, I have built a dummy dataset.

**Goal**: The goal of this project was to learn and apply machine learning algorithms, to forecast the sales of an company available in the dataset I created.

**Algorithms covered in the notebook include:**

  1. Linear Regression
  2. Random Forest

**Output:**
